>Before you leap to using this version of IRClib in IRClient, I ought to
>point out that I have fiddled with other bits of this program, and the
>other fiddlings may not exactly be to your liking.
>
>For example, a CTCP VERSION doesn't (at least, I think) send "0.22
>(unregistered)(VH1.16)" any more - it now sends "North American Indian
>smoke signal chat (Stuart Bruce's groovy penguin version 8.FISH)"
>
>Similarly a CTCP PING should now return "I think you ought to know that
>your microwave has finished- it's pinging".
>
>My deepest apologies for any inconvenience this has caused. You could
>always change the relevant lines back to their status in the previous
>IRClib if you prefer youre IRClient to be dull...! :-)
>
>"So, how do I use the colours?" I hear you cry. Well, when you want to
>the change the colour of text in the middle of a string, you simply use
>the '|' character. Then you follow this character with a colour code:-
>
>The codes 0-7 are for the eight shades of grey (I just found out about
>these), with black being 0 and white being 7, and the other colours are
>as follows...
>
>    = Black (That's a space)
>  B = Blue/Cyan
>  C = Cream
>  N = Navy/Dark blue
>  E = Emerald/Light green
>  G = (Dark) green
>  O = Orange
>  R = Red
>  W = White
>  Y = Yellow
>
>If you can think of better keys/names for the colours that dont clash
>with each other then feel free to change them (It's all in the
>INSTR("WWWWWW... bit)
>
>"Ahh, but what if I want to use the '|' character?" I hear you ask. To
>use the '|' character you must type two of them, '||'.
>
>Finally, a word of warning. This affects all strings that come after a
>command, so if you want to change your nick/join a channel with '|' in
>the name, remember to use '||'.
