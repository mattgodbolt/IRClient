IRClient v.22

This is a modified version of IRClient 0.22 by Matthew Godbolt.

The only files that have been changed are

Templates (of which the old ones are still included - Templates2)
IRClib

This version of IRClib is a modified version of Vince Hudd's version
- which can be obtained from
http://www.argonet.co.uk/softrock/
Which also has the instructions for the new commands that he has
added.



There is another piece of code by myself called "r_incode"
which is just another piece of code to do with the Remote actions
part of the script.


The main modifications are the ability to use another user remotely
who is using the same script, or who has modified their script to
read the CTCP commands send out by this one.

There are also a few other commands added which are documented in the
"newcomms" file.  The remote commands are documented in the file
"rcomms".


*****
This version of the script will now also work with v.22 :-)

ALSO, I am NOT to be held responsible for any Remote actions from any
other user, for instance, joining you onto a "non-desirable" channel.
