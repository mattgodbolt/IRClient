New Commands for IRCLib script version 0.22
by Stuart Winter

Where there is "[¤]" it indicates that you need to be a channel
operator on the channel where the action is performed.

==
/TC

syntax: /TC <channel name> <message to the channel>
eg.   : /TC ArgoNet looks through the window and comes in

note, this command doesn't need a " # " chaaracter.

What it does is to put the equivelant of a '/ME' command into the
channel without you neccessarily being on it.

It also puts a message into the server window telling you which
channel you have sent it to, and what message has been sent.

The errors you may incure whilst using this command is that you do
not have any privileges to talk to the channel - this is probably
because someone has disabled extranal messages to the channel.
==

/NTCHANGE [¤]
syntax: /NTCHANGE

All this command does is to stop non channel operators of the
currently selected channel from changing the topic.

This was added because occasionally the /MODE #<channel> didn't work

==

/LETTOPIC [¤]
syntax: /LETTOPIC

Respectivly, this command is the reverse of the /NTCHANGE command.

==

/SECRET [¤]
syntax: /SECRET

All this command does is to simply change the mode of the channel so
that it is "Private","Secret" and "Invite only".  It is basically
easier than typing #MODE #<channel> +p +s +i
Also, this command only operates on the currently selcted channel
(eg. the one which you are talking to - the window for that channel
is yellow)

==

/UNSECRET  [¤]
syntax: /UNSECRET

This command is the reverse of /SECRET

==

/TOTALBAN  [¤]
syntax: /TOTALBAN

This command bans absoultely everyone from getting onto the channel
which you are currently talking to.  However, I do not reccommend
using it on public channels (eg. #acorn, #argonet etc) as you may
find yourself quite flamed :-)


==

/TOTALUNBAN [¤]
syntax: /TOTALUNBAN

This command is the reverse of /TOTALBAN

This command is more useful - as it as unbans all ban lists, and will
then let anybody on.  

==

/MSGWINDOW
syntax: /MSGWINDOW <user_on_irc>

What this command does is to open a query window to the user which
you specify.
This command is mainly only useful when you can not click on their
user name because you aren't on the channel which they are on - for
example, someone is /MSGing you and their messages are ariving in the
"Server Messages" window.  So, to save you typing 
"/MSG <whoever> <what ever message>", you simply open a window to
them, and all their text will arrive in it, and you can talk back
inside the window.

==

/MY
syntax: /MY dog is black

This command performs exactly the same operation as a /ME, except
that this puts " 's " before the text.
So the other users see:
"*MoZes 's dog is black"
(however, on your screen there is no space before the " 's ", and
your user name.

==

/MD
syntax: /MD prefer chocolate to a strawberry

This command is exactly the same as /MY exept that is puts a 
" 'd " after the user name.

==

/OH
syntax: /OH

Since most people on IRC seem to say "Oh" quite a lot, because they
can't be bothered to type., " oh, okay" etc. This command has been
added.

What it does is to simply put the text "Oh, right, okay" in the
screen.

==

/ARGONET
syntax: /ARGONET

This command simply joins onto the channel #ArgoNet

==

/ACORN
syntax: /ACORN

The easy way to join #Acorn :-)

==


/BRB
syntax: /BRB [any reason]

This simply displays 
"*MoZes will BRB (<the reason if any given>)"

==

/BACK
syntax: /BACK

This simply tells the users that you are back
(works along with the BRB command)

==
/AGE
syntax: /AGE

This displays your age on the screen in the form of
a /ME command - you have to set your age in the script
(which is at the top of the script)

==

/ISN
syntax: /ISN

This simply says that you aren't doing something
for instance..
somebody says "*Jim is going down the pub and going to get drunk"
you could put

/ISN :-((
which would produce 
"*MoZes isn't :-(("

==
/IS
syntax: /IS

This command is the same as /ISN but says "Is" :-)

==

/CYA
syntax: /CYA [reason]

This command informs the users that you are leaving the channel by
saying "*MoZes is leaving now.. bye.." (assuming you were called
"MoZes".

However, if you had a reason for leaving, or were going to come back
later then you could put

/CYA be back about 10pm

Which would put on the screen
"*MoZes is leaving now.. bye.. (be back about 10pm)"
(and yes, it does put the brackets in)

==

/EMAIL
syntax: /EMAIL [anything else you want to say about it]

This command puts your email address on the screen as in the form of
a /ME command.  (You need to edit the script to change the email
address)

If you want to say anything else about it.. for instance, that you
will be changing it soon.. then put..

/EMAIL I'll be changing it soon tho

==

/URL
syntax: URL [anything else you want to say about it]

This command does the same thing as /EMAIL except that this displays
your www address.
Again, you have to edit the script to set it.

==

/QOP [¤]
syntax: /QOP

This command promotes a specified list of people (which is in the
variable at the very top of the script) to Channel operator status.
The point of this is because occasionally when "nasty" people decide
to take over the channel, (de opping people) this is the best way to
try and regain control.  By promoting people to channel operators
again quickly, they can then quickly kick the offender off the
channel and restore order.

Of course, you have to make sure that you are quick enough, before you
get deopped :-)

To edit the list of people, simply add their name to the list.

This list of people is also the same as the list of people who automatically
get prompted to chanop status.

==

/JOINTOG
syntax: /JOINTOG

This command simply dictates whether or not as soon as you are kicked
off a channel, you rejoin is straight away.
Useful if people are messing around.

==
/OPALL [¤]
syntax: /OPALL

This command works in basically the same manner as the autogreets do,
however, what this does is to Automatically Promote /any/ new user
who joins the particular channel that you are on to ChanOp status.
(Of course, you need to be a chanop to actually get the command to 
be able to do it)

The reason behind this is basically because, say, if the channel is
Invite-Only, then the new user /must/ have been invited - so you may
assume that they are legibale to have chanop status straight away.
And of course, they don't have to be in any autop op list.

==

/IRCLOG 
syntax: /IRCLOG <filename to log the channels into>

What this command does is to simply take
almost /everything/ that enters the screen and place it into
a file specified by the user.

Basically, this is useful for seeing what people have said on
a particular night or something, or just basically if you are
testing a command on the screen and want to record the results.
Whatever u can think of - I'm sure u can think of an appropriate
reason for its use.

It does not record the /NOTIFY or /IGNORE or /STATUS command
outputs to the screen as I didn't see any reason whatsoever
for making it do it.
What it does it to take everthing else tho and put it inside
a text file like this...

 (#ArgoNet) <Gelfink> 1996
 (#argonet) <Wheetzy> I don't have another address because we only have one computer
 (#ArgoNet) <Gelfink> 2001
 (#ArgoNet) ~* MoZes is logging now
 (#ArgoNet) <foggy> :-p
 (#ArgoNet) <Gelfink> I have one computer and two addresses
 (#ArgoNet) <MoZes> whets: but aegonet do extra ines - I used to have 2 when I wa on argonet
 (#ArgoNet) ~* MoZes turns off logging
 
I hope they don't mine me putting that there :-)

[the case differences in #ArgoNet are because Gelf and Foggy have joined
Argonet through the /ARGONET command in my script]
 
The channel name in brackets also changes say, if I was on
#Acorn at the same time - messages from acorn would also
be stored in the same file - so you might have one line from
#ArgoNet and one from #Acorn.
Also, it records your MSGs :-P

Also, as you can see - where I have started logging, I 
did a /ME action - it records them by putting a ~ infront of it..
infact, it does that for /all/ ACTION CTCPs.


==

/ENDIRCLOG
syntax: /ENDIRCLOG

This command turns off IRCLogging.

==
  
/SENDTOIRC
syntax: /SENDTOIRC <text to send to the IRC server>

This command simply sends anything you want to the IRC server,
just incase I haven't already done a command which does it :-)

Just for an example..

/SENDTOIRC names #acorn

for example would display the names of the people who are
on the channel #acorn.
(of course you can already do that with the /NAMES command..
but its usefull for other things)


========

/BOTOP 
syntax: /BOTOP <registered password with the bot>

This command sends a private message to the bot to
1) Identify yourself to it by sending a message 
   Ident <your password>
   this is so that ot makes sure it recognises you first

2) Sends another message telling it you want to be opped
   Op <your password>

Then hopefully, the bot will recognise you and give you
ops - assuming you have the right password :-)

At the moment, the IRClib is configured to use the 
bot JadZia which is hanging around on channel
#ArgoNet... but you can change it
(its at the top of the program called
your_bot$="JadZia"  --- just change the name
to which ever bot you want)

=====

/LIFELINE
syntax: /LIFELINE <on> [but NOT off]

This command is useful because when you leave the computer
connected to IRC - you may sometimes get pinged out
by whichever server you're connected to because you haven't
said anything to it for a while.

What it does is to keep sending a MSG to 
yourself, and putting the results inside a query
window - so it doesn't mess up the channel that you are on.

It will perform an MSG to yourself everytime someone on the channel
says something, or someone messages you - infact, it works
at the same time as the NOTIFY command.

To turn this command off, just type
/LIFELINE
[then close the query window yourself :-)  ]

===

/NUPDATE
syntax: /NUPDATE

This command is simply updates the user table on the
right hand side of IRCLient's channel window.

What it does, is to simply send a NAMES command to the 
server requesting the names of everyone on the channel
that you have currently selected in IRClient - and
this then updates the user table, and also shows
on the screen who is on the channel.

This is useful because sometimes IRCLient doesn't
quite pick up on the fact that someone's left or joined
and to save you changing you nick so that it updates
the screen - you can now simply do this instead.

====

/TIME
syntax: /TIME

This command simply shows the current time on whatever channel/window
is selected.

==


/MODE  [¤]
syntax: /MODE <mode change | mode change>

This command changes the modes of the currently selected channel.
And circulates through all of them passed to it and applies them
individually, as you can see on the screen.

The original MODE command only worked for single mode changes,
but this one can have as many as you want, as long as they
are seperated by spaces.

e.g.

/MODE +s +p +m +i
etc etc..

NOTE:  You don't include the channel name with this command, as
in its predecessor.. as I didn't really see the point :-)
Also, this command does NOT support chanop promotions
(eg. /mode +o ircuser) , or  bans
or indeed, any other command that requires a IRC User's
name to be passed to it.
For Chanop promotion use /OP - /deOP
For Ban, use /BAN


===

/HI
syntax: /HI

This command reads the nickname of the last person who joined
the selected channel, and then says "Hiya <whoever>"

Its not an autogreet- and saves you from typing out their
full name -or shortening it somewhat.

==

/MACINFO
syntax: /MACINFO <user>

This command simply performs a CTCP MACHINEINFO on the selected 
user.  Basically an easy way of typing /CTCP <user> MACHINEINFO

Note:  You may /not/ always get a reply to from this though, 
this is because MACHINEINFO is non-standard - and only exists
in IRCClient 0.21 and upwards.

==

/PING
syntax: /PING <user>

This command performs a CTCP <user> PING 
quicker than /CTCP <user> PING

==

/VER
syntax: /VER <user>

Same as above, but issues a CTCP VERSION which
reports the version of the IRC Client that they are
using back to you.

However, people using RAW IRC or dismayl.demon.co.uk,port23
won't issue a version code back - this also goes for
some IRC CLients

==

/TIM
syntax: /TIM <user>

This does the same as the above but issues a 
CTCP <user> TIME.

Note : the CTCP TIME function on some versions
of IRCClient may cause them to crash - this is
due to an error in the code of the main program.

==

/SKICK [¤]
syntax: /SKICK

This command either activates or deactivates the
swear kicking procedure.

When active, this procedure scans whatever is going
to the channels that you are on, and checks whether
a person has said a swear word that is present in your
swear word list (which is at the top of the client - 
clearly visible :-)  ).

If it does find a word matching one of the words in 
this list, then it will kick them off (ONLY if you
have chan op privileges though).
However, if /you/ type in a swear word - then it
will NOT kick you off :-)

You can toggle this command by just typing 
/SKICK  - it will show you a little window on 
the screen as to what it's status is every time
you use the command.
You can also see what status it is, by typing
/STATUS.

note: When using this procedure, if you have a 
slowish computer, you will probably notice a short
delay before the text gets displayed to the screen
(It will probably look like you are experiencing lag)
This is simply because it takes a short time to check
the sentance (esp if its a large one) against the
swear list.

I WOULD NOT advise you to *EVER* use this command
alongside the IRCLOG command because you will almost
grind to a halt!!


=====

/TEXTLINE
syntax: /TEXTLINE <filename>

This command takes the filename passed to it, and reads the file
and puts it onto the screen so everyone else can see it (basically
it saves you typing it out).  Its a simple as that.

Now, at the moment, this command could be described as 'bugged'. 
This is because it has to look for a certain marker in the file
to determin the end of it.. this isn't because I'm stupid, and 
don't know how to check for the end of files using EOF, but because
IRCLient doesn't support (that I know of) the EOF command.. so unless
you have the marker at the end of the file, then you will get an 
"End of file" error from IRclient in the debug window.

The marker that you need to put at the end of the file is
just one of these characters.

 -   ¤   -

So, take this text for example...
"Yes, I really would like to buy your really over priced hard disks
even though I know that they are, because I like the way that you 
have nice pictures on your receipts¤"
As you can see, the marker (¤) at the end will stop the text there, and
then the file will get closed and all that text will be displayed.

Of course, though, you shouldn't pass massive ammounts of text through
the command - as it may cause IRClient to crash, or the server to 
think you're flooding or something.

==

/ADDOP
syntax: /ADDOP <new users too add to the auto ops lists>

This command temporarily adds people to your auto ops lists.
It makes a completely new one - so that when you type /SHOWOPS
you will notice that there is now an extra list.

To add them permenantly, you should add them into the script.

==

/SHOWOPS
syntax:  /SHOWOPS

This command dumps onto the screen, the whole list of people
who get auto opped.

No particular use - but there you go! :-)

==

/VOICE [¤]
syntax: /VOICE <user>

This command lets a particular IRC user to talk on a channel
which is moderated (ie. only chan ops may talk).

==

/NOVOICE [¤]
syntax: /NOVOICE <user>

This command is the opposite of /VOICE  so if the user
does not have chan ops on the channel, and it is
moderated - they can't talk.


=====




******CHANGES*******

/TOTALUNBAN

This command previously used to simply unban a mask of "*!*@*" and
that was simply it.  However, this DOES NOT remove every ban assigned
to the channel.

What this command does, is to actually now unban /everything/ that is
set the channel - which is clearly visible on the channel.

It works by you typing /TOTALUNBAN, then requesting a ban list from
the server, and then removing every one that is passed to it.

This however, isn't a transient command - it remains active until it
is disabled by /TOTALUNBAN... which means, that whenever a ban list
is requested from the server (by typing either 
/BAN or /MODE #channel +b), all of the bans will be removed.

So, if you *just* want to view the ban list, then you will have to turn
off the unbanning.

You can tell whether or not the unbanning is on, by looking at the
status from the command /STATUS

========

/TIME
syntax
This command has been just slightly edited so that it returns
the time in the format of AM and PM, instead of the 24hr clock.
This is because I sit there trying to work out what the hell the
time is! :-)

This also goes for the /CTCP <user> TIME
==





===





At the top of the IRCLib Script, there is some code which dictates
which users automatically get auto opped - I have left some people in
it - so you can see how it works, as it is now programmed differently
from last time, so that you can now have an almost infinate number
of people in the list .. and not get limited to a 255character
text string.

  ** PLEASE REMOVE THE PEOPLE FROM THE LIST THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW EXIST! **
