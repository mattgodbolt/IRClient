Modifications:
===============

*  From version 0.63 - the swear kick acility has now been
   changed slightly, so that it actually kicks the offender
   of the channel they offended on - instead of attempting
   to kick them off your currently selected channel.
   So in other words - it now works /correctly/ :-)

*  From the original script, I noticed that when people
   perform a /ME <blah blah>  from INSIDE a query window,
   it comes out on the main channel as any normal /ME
   would from people talking publically (Ie. to the channel
   so other people are SUPPOSED to see what they said).
 
   However, what was happening was that if the person
   on the other end, did NOT have a query window opened to
   the person sending the PRIVATE message via their query window,
   and they did a /ME - it simply appeared in the main channel
   window - looking like others had seen what was said - when
   they hadn't.  This causes people to reply to the MAIN channel
   window - obsiously not making /any/ sense whatso ever to
   the other channel members.


   SO my fix has cured this - as it will show any ACTIONS
   (/MEs) which are PRIVATE up as
   "/*\ <whoever> <whatever message>"
   (e.g. "/*\ MoZes dances around")  

   And they also appear in a nice (?!) light blue colour
   so they easily stand out from the Public ones.


*  As soon as you join the channel, or as soon as any
   channel mode change takes place, all of the channel
   modes will be shown on the screen, as well as the 
   message saying who made the change  (this was supposed 
   to happen in the original script, but it just doesn't
   seem to work.. it does now though! :-)  )

*  When you make someone a channel operator it shows;
   "* You have made <whoever> a channel operator"
   When someone makes YOU a channel operator is shows;
   "* <whoever> has made you a channel operator"
   When someone else makes someone else an operator it shows;
   "* <whoever> has made <whoever> a channel operator"
 
  This just makes it easy to see what is happening - 
  esp for newbies who might not know what all of the channel
  modes actually mean.
