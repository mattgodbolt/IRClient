Ok, heres the list of new commands which are in the
program which are associated with the Remote stuff..


/STATUS
This displays the current status of all of the 
Remote commands, and some of the other ones which
I have added to the script.


/RIPTOG 
This command toggles whether or not the RIPP is allowed to take
place.  If for some odd reason, you _really_ want people to be able
to do this then set it.

/NOTE <user> <Message>
This produces the nice little window.

/NOTETOG
This either enables or disables whether the messages will come up or
not from the other user sending the command.

/RJOIN <user> <channel>
This command remotely joins a user to another channel, and _now_ it
shows on your screen in the little window who actually did it :-)

Remember though, you don't include the " # " character.

/RLEAVE <user> <channel>
This is the opposite of /RJOIN


/RTOG

This command dictates whether or not remote users will be able to
send remote commands through you or not.


/RME <user> <text>

Performs a /ME from the remote user


/RTEXT <user> <text/command line>

This is a _pretty_damn_useful_command in that not only can you just
send text messgaes to the screen through the other person, but you
can also perform commands.

E.g. /RTEXT <person_with_this_script> /kick <user_u_don't_like>
