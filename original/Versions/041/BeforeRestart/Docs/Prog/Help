Help file structure
===================
Help files are quite simple to put together, but need quite a bit of work
doing to the current interface - suggestions please...

Basically you should include a header line like :
  <subject>
  =========

at the top of all index files, and :
  Syntax: <generic syntax>

at the top of all the specific files. If you could settype the specific files
as Text and index and support files as Data it will make life easier (though
it won't affect the program).

The files themselves should be formatted to 68 characters wide (off the
Edit.Word Wrap option in Zap) so that they don't wrap strangely, and should
NOT begin with a colon (:). Colons at the start of a line introduce an
embedded command to the displayer. The character following the colon is the
command type.

Currently only one command type is supported - the > link command. This is in
the form :
  :>text to show>linkfile
And consecutive lines of lines will be joined together in a form of table -
this looks nasty sometimes, but I may fix it soon.

Other than that, the only read thing you need to know is that the command
line :END is reserved for the last line of the file and MUST be followed by a
return.
