                                The X-Files module
                                ------------------
                                
The X-Files module is required for the help system due to it's use of long
filenames. To make life easier on the general populace and to stop my
worrying who has X-Files I am providing the module. I believe it to be
written by Wonderworks, but I forget exactly as there is no documentation in
the actual application I extracted it from.

I believe it to be distributable.
