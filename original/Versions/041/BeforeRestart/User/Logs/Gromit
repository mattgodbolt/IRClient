     *Gromit* I'll send it if U want...
    *TheMoog* No, s'alright
    *TheMoog* Free advice> Don't mention pirated software on a channel where the authors frequently log on
     *Gromit* my copy of artworse isn't pirated
    *TheMoog* ..but you were going to send it to us ;)
     *Gromit* ah, but I didn't mention that on the channel..
    * TheMoog looks *very* apologetic
    *TheMoog* You're 100% right
    * TheMoog blushes
    *TheMoog* Sorry!
     *Gromit* 's OK, I should be saying sorry 2 U, I havn't registered 0.16 yet!
    *TheMoog* No worries - you can't - 0.16 doesn't have the registration code in it - try getting 0.41 when it comes out soon, or get 0.38
     *Gromit* I don't like having all those windoze in the later versions tho :(
    *TheMoog* Oh right :|
