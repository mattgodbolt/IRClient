     <Jaffa_> Never heard of it...
    <TheMoog> IRBasic = my OO version of Basic 5 as used in IRClient
     <Jaffa_> Wassat?
    <TheMoog> DEF PROCList_Iterate(function$)
    <TheMoog>  LOCAL next,list
     <Jaffa_> Moog: Nope don't use that - is the code accessible, I might get IRClient to have a look (don't need it - don't have Acorn net access)
    <TheMoog>  list = @
    <TheMoog>  WHILE list<>0
    <TheMoog>   REM next is used in case function$ changes the state of the

    <TheMoog>   PROC(function$)(list.data)
    <TheMoog>   list = next
    <TheMoog>  ENDWHILE
    <TheMoog> ENDPROC
    <TheMoog> Jagfa_: That's code from the next release, user editable and all
     <Jaffa_> Moog: Looks quite cool...
    <TheMoog> It's a bit stuck in IRClient atm, although I forsee it becoming a standalone
     <Jaffa_> No, but I use Basic++ which I was going to release comercially (or summit) which is an OO version of BBC Basic, 
    <TheMoog> Cool
     <Jaffa_> 'cept it twas too slow
    <TheMoog> Great minds think alike
    <TheMoog> Oh right
    <TheMoog> IRBasic isn't the speediest of implementations, but then it was kinda made up as I went along
    * TheMoog grins
     <Jaffa_> The ideas learnt are being used in WimpWorks v2 though...
    <TheMoog> Fast enough, anyway
    <TheMoog> JafF> I forsee IRBasic becoming a nice RAD tool
    <TheMoog> Has wuite a lot of the JAVA introspection kind of stuff which can be used in GUI buiklders
    <TheMoog> Replace Acorn's awful toolbox
     <Jaffa_> Like I see WimpWorks
    * TheMoog hsan't seen WW - what is it?
*** aok (~InLine@max04-210.enterprise.net) has left channel #acorn
     <Jaffa_> Might be useful for WW v00 then...
     <Jaffa_> (ie. in 2000 or whenever)
     <Jaffa_> Similar idea to VB but for ROS.
    <TheMoog> Hmmm
    <TheMoog> Yeah - that was my goal for IRBasic too
     <Jaffa_> VB = Visual Basic
    <TheMoog> We need RAD tools to get ppl programming again for the acorn series...Toolbox is *shite*

    <TheMoog> Does anyone out there like the toolbox?
