+ Wrote entirely new parser, slower but will work even if
  tags are split across lines.
+ Entites '&amp;' and '&#163;' (pound sign) are handled.
+ Added configuration code so that the URL and the
  headline-tag can both be modified if neccessary.  The
  module will assume defaults if none are available.
+ Altered the credits. ;)

- Long lines.
- Using Netplex over loopback with certain speed settings,
  causes the Headlines module to not receive the whole of
  the HTML input even though Netplex confirms that the
  whole file was sent.
- URL handling could be better.
