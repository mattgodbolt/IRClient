                           Magrathea IRClient script
                           =========================

    "Whatever your tastes, Magrathea can cater for you. We are not proud."

Introduction
------------
IRClient is a very powerful program in that it allows you to develop your own
scripts using a language which is in essence BASIC. Because of this, it is
very easy to develop different parts of the scripts so that they can perform
tasks other than those we currently have. For this reason, my self (Gerph)
and Zarni have developed what we hope to be a quite expandable and structured
script.

Most of the code is based on TheMoog's original code, but has been modified
to our own tastes and hopefully for the greater good. If you have any
comments on the Magrathea script, please contact us at the addresses at the
bottom of this file.


<< This is all rubbish now that the new structure has been 'imposed' :-)
Anyone want to re-write ? >>


How to install Magrathea
------------------------
Open the !IRClient application and simply copy the Scripts directory into it,
then modify your !IRClient.Scripts.IRC file (in BASIC mode) so that the first
'LOAD' command in the file reads:

LOAD "<IRClient$Dir>.Scripts.Magrathea.IRCLib"

You may wish to take a copy of the old Scripts directory in the event of
Magrathea not being to your liking (although we will do our best to change it
so that it /is/ to your liking).

Once installed you should try connecting to an IRC Server, or use Gerph's
local !IRServer application to test it offline. Help can be gained by using
/Help.

Upgrading
---------
Upgrading is currently slightly different in that you will probably be
supplied with a copy of the Config file when you get Magarthea. If you wish to keep your old configuration you should copy this file
(!IRClient.Scripts.Magrathea.Resources.Config) somewhere, copy the new
Magrathea in to the directory and then put the Config file back.
