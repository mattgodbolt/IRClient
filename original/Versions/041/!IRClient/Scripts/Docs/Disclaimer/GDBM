                              ---------------

The GDBM module is covered by the GNU public license. I am required by this
to give the location of the source for the code. I direct you to the Perl
5.001 port to RiscOS (1.51) which can be found on Hensa, Sunsite and at
Demon.

The GDBM module was ported by Steve Ellacott <S.W.Ellacott@brighton.ac.uk>.
