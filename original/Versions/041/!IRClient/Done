Done:

è Rather late...single line IFs - only needed 6 lines changing....dunno why
  I didn't do it at the start...

è Removal of loadsa defunct calls to StripSpaces in IRBasic which are not needed
  now 'cos of all whitespace being stripped on load

è New hton function (htonl()) as stolen from ARM - very cunning :))) Have a
  loook (it's in IRCSource)

è SynchCodeAreas parameters fixed (didn't actually realise it took any!)

è Bug in the whitespace stripper fixed (no more memory freed tho' :( )

è Dave Thomas' Templates and sprites added, and a minor fix to the redraw code
  imped to make them look better.

è PROC re-entrancy problems fixed - your new code should now work!

è Memory wrapper routines and strcmp/strlen routines streamlined, and made
  cache-aware == more speed!!!!!!!! (noticeably, even!)

è Clipboard stuff added so key bindings can use clipboard

è Bug in File class fixed - which shows up the following problem:
NB BUG IN += AND -= - don't use @ or FN on either side till I work out why!

è Magrathea changed to use single-line IFs - although I think it's a bit older
  than the one you've got - check first!

Enjoy!
