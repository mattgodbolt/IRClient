!IRClient is © 1997 Matthew Godbolt and Justin Fletcher

!IRClient is Shareware.  You may download, use and freely distribute unaltered copies of the unregistered version.  The unregistered version is clearly marked so, and is also equivalent to the registered version in
operation. However, if you feel that you are getting a tenner's worth of enjoyment out of it I'd ask you to send me 10UKP for which you will get a fully registered version, and free electronic updates if you so desire.  The registered version is *not* distributable and is marked with your name.

The ten pounds will be used to try and pay BT when the bill next comes round - as a student (as many of you are) it's not easy - so your tenner helps!

I reserve the right to change this license in future versions.

The ZapRedraw module is used with kind permission from its author, and is copyright 1994 Dominic Symes.  The associated help files on how to use ZapRedraw in your own programs, and its license can be found in !Zap, which is available on most good ftp sites and BBS's.
