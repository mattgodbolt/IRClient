!IRClient - IRC client for RISC OS
=========   ======================

For license details please see the file !IRClient.!Help.License

IRClient is an easy(ish) to use IRC client for RISC OS.  It should be
reasonably straightforward to understand if you have IRC experience, but if not
you'd better check the documents in the directory which should have opened when
this document did.

*******************************  PLEASE NOTE  ******************************* 

è This program requires the InetDB module, which is a Freeware DNS lookup
  module by Stewart Brodie.  This is supplied with the excellent ArcWeb -
  in my opinion the best WWW browser available for Risc OS.  InetDB is also
  available separately.  Both of these products are available at Stewart's
  WWW site: http://www.dsse.ecs.soton.ac.uk:8080/freenet/ and ArcWeb is also
  on HENSA and its mirrors.

è This program *WILL NOT WORK WITH THE DOGGYSOFT TERMITE INTERNET SUITE*
  Please don't blame me for this - complain to Doggysoft for using a non-
  standard API for their TCP/IP stack, which IMHO nails the coffin down as far
  as my buying Termite...

è This program isn't Freeware.   It's Shareware, and myself and Justin would
  really like it if you could spare a tenner for a full version.  We're both
  poor students you see.

Thanks for reading this file!!  Now please go read the Docs in the directory
