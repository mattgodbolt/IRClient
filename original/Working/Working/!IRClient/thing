Skeleton window class must implement :

wClick(xoff,yoff,selNotAdj*,iconh)
wMenu(xoff,yoff,iconh)
wRedraw(redrawx0,redrawy0,redrawx1,redrawy1)
        : as offsets from window class,
        : redrawx0 = redraw rect minx - window x0 position - scrollx
wOpen(scrrenxmin,screenymin, ..., as given,scrx,scry,behind)
wClose(flags) bit 0 = shift held down; bit 1 = adjust closed
wEnter
wLeave
wKey(charcode, icon)
wFocus(gainNotLost, icon)

* - is actually button flags
Perhaps menu should return xabs, yabs?
