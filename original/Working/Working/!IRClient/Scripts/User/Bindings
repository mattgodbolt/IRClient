# This is a bindings file for IRClient
# The format is :
# [^][‹]<key> <functions>
# Where <key> is a key, such as A, B, F1, DELETE, BACKSPACE, RETURN etc
# <functions> is a list of functions, each separated by ' :: '
# A function with no parameters calls the IRBasic PROCedure directly, such
# as 'CycleFocusForwards'
# A function with parameters is called with one parameter pointing to a linked
# list of the supplied parameters, which will either be integer values, or
# String objects.  String objects are created only if the first character of
# a parameter is a string, so to pass string variables to the procedure you
# must use Function(""+variable$)
# There are a number of callback functions defined in Scripts.KeyBinder, which
# the default binding file uses.
# Note that you must use spaces between the key and the commands - not TAB
# characters

# Control Q closes a window, Control Shift Q also leaves it if were a channel
^Q      CycleFocusForwards :: _CloseDisplay(""+Display$)
^‹Q     CycleFocusForwards :: _Leave(""+Display$)

# Shift up and down move the focus from window to window
‹Up     CycleFocusForwards
‹Down   CycleFocusBackwards

# Clipboard and selection control
^‹C     CopySelection
^‹V     PasteSelection
^Z      ClearSelection
