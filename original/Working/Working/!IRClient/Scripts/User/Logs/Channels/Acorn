   <IRClient> Hi Gromit
     <Statto> oh doesn't worrk on the new version.
     <Gromit> ello there :)
   <IRClient> Hmm... IRclient is interesting...

      <gerph> unc: You may be semi good, but *IRClient* is a law unto itself :-)
*** CTCP VERSION received from Wibble
      <gerph> unc: I don't go into the source if I can help it..
   <charlie_> zhad: there's shockwave there, but Browse won't play it :( It seems to need Javascript
    <unCiscy> So that means I can't 'borrow' it's interpreter?  Damn. :)
      <gerph> unc: The asm is pretty stable; it's the basic that needs the work...
*** cmj (noone@physcorn.demon.co.uk) has joined channel #acorn
   <IRClient> Hi cmj
      <gerph> well... you'd have to speak to matt...
    * unCiscy thinks JavaScript should be burt, or implemented.  Either would be nice...
    <unCiscy> Burnt, sorry.
        <cmj> ummm...
     <Statto> there going to implement it soon.
        <cmj> WebsterXL does JavaScript ;)
    <unCiscy> Rarther badly, I'm told...
      <tonyh> I heard it does everything rather badly
        <cmj> well, it is from aesey eye
   <charlie_> I'm not buying another browser... i've got five on my computer here....
       <Xyra> next version of Browse apparentl has Javascript
    <unCiscy> gerph> Just out of interest, are you dialing up on Matt's account?
   <IRClient> yes, Netscape's JavaScript
   <IRClient> unc: Yes
      <tonyh> I do know SSL is now available for Browse
      <gerph> but you have to have bought browse, and prove that you are in the UK
    <unCiscy> gerph> Does he read email sent to matthew@willothewisp.demon.co.uk?
   <IRClient> yes
      <tonyh> But you have to ask for it by email because they're not allowed to export it
   <IRClient> although you might be better contacting him as :
   <IRClient> matthew@argonaut.com
   * charlie_ has had no response about https:
    <unCiscy> I'll send an entire email inclosed in <grovel> tags...
      <tonyh> Would having a web script to check for a .uk email address (or other common ISPs like Enterprise) not be secure enough?
      <gerph> tonyh: Not to outdo UK export licences apparently
        <cmj> btw ppl, how much is an ISA SCSI card?
        <cmj> (for a PC) ;)
*** Unknown CTCP 'FACE' received from gerph
      <tonyh> Do you also have to prove you bought the CD?
*** Unknown CTCP 'CAFE' received from cmj
      <tonyh> My copy's from the ISV site
      <gerph> tonyh: I think you have to prove you bought it...
      <gerph> tonyh: Mines from the dev site, upgraded using the normal installer; I don't think I qualify...
      <tonyh> I suppose it's worth asking though, I can quote my ISV codes
      * gerph can't though :(
      <tonyh> gerph: Mine too
      <tonyh> Is your ISV status rather dodgy then?
      <gerph> tonyh: Yeah...
      <tonyh> :)
      <gerph> anyone know charcole's email address ?
      <tonyh> I think I'm on reasonably safe ground, I was given RGSC's password by the "management"
