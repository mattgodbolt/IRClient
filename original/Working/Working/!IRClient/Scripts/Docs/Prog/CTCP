Adding CTCP commands
====================

Requests
--------
CTCP Requests (from other users) will come through :
  PROCOverload_UnknownCTCPRequest(from$,to$,command$,str$)
You should recognise the command (already capitalised) and pass on unless you
do something with it. from$ is provided so that you know which channel it was
broadcast to (if applicable)

Enumerate
---------
You will be asked to give a list of any CTCP commands you provide for the
CLIENTINFO command through :
  FNOverload_ListCTCP(num)
You should use code like :
  DEFFNOverload_ListCTCP(count)
  LOCAL ret$
  IF count=0 THEN
   ret$="<command>"
  ELSE
   ret$=FN@(count-1)
  ENDIF
  =ret$
where <command> may be a space seperated list of commands if more than one is
provided. 

Replies
-------
Replies to CTCP commands will come through :
  PROCOverload_UnknownCTCPReply(from$,command$,str$)
You should recognise the command (already capitalised) and pass on unless you
do something with it.

Other
-----
There is currently no means to catch user use of /CTCP <command>. If this is
required then you should contact me (gerph@essex.ac.uk) for details and I'll
add the hooks in.
