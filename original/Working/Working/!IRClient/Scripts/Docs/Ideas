Ideas
-----
Overload_ScriptInfo should become a linked list of scripts.

Buffers should become class instances everywhere.

FTP should be a class that you can communicate with to read the
directory contents out and transfer files to streams and vice-
versa. Then the actual visualisation of the thing can be made
into something handled by a seperate module.
