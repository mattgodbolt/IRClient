This is out of date WRT everything in the entire universe.

THIS RELEASE v1.20
============
Major historical changes:
  v1.13 DCC Chat works safely
  v1.14 DCC Send seems to work safely, and has filetype added on end
  v1.15 Restructured the Magrathea directories
  v1.16 Dependancy checking added
  v1.17 Restructured the Scripts directory to be /just/ Magrathea
        Released to Dave Thomas and Matthew Godbolt
  v1.18 Additional overloads to make 'hooks' easier.
        Examples.AutoGreet sent out to Stuart Bruce, Vince Hodd, and
        Stuart Winter. FTP added.
        Released to Dave Thomas, Alex Howarth and Chris Johns for
        testing and comments. COMPLETE release, including IRClient 0.27.
  v1.19 Work done whilst Matt and over the intermediate weeks :
        Memory leaks fixed, indirected procedure calls added, menus made
        script definable. Internal directory now required as Internal.Boot
        is now the initial script. Internal.Menus defines the main menus,
        overloadable to add new entries at relevant points.
        Wimp messages added and made use of with ExtEdit library (simple
        controller - no saves, no returns). Wildcards fixed.
        DCC ditched and started from scratch using indirected functions
        and a simpler programming interface (new structure too).
        Scheduler made redundant.
  v1.20 Work done to make 'classified'
        Dependency classified
        User.Excludes format has changed.
  
Structure of directory :

Scripts :
|
+-Internal :
|    Contains many internal routines for providing 'base' facilities
|    The majority of these should be veneers for the main script functions
|
+-Default :
|    Scripts and resources which are explicitly loaded by Magrathea on startup.
|    Mostly these are required routines and support for simple things
|
+-Docs :
| |  Documentation for the complete release of Magrathea.
| |
| +-Disclaimer :
| |    Disclaimers for the various extension modules and resources
| |    This may be moved to their respective directories in future
| |
| +-Prog :
|      Programming hints, guides and reminders for myself and others
|      This is NOT guarenteed to be up to date. Not yet anyhow.
|
|
+-Examples :
|    Any example code that people have put together along with a description
|    of how it works.
|
+-Magrathea :
|    The main engine for Magrathea.
|    This script will load each of the Default scripts and initailise them,
|    before scanning the Modules directory for extensions. The bulk of IRC
|    proper is processed here.
|
+-Modules :
|    Extension scripts reside in here, either as a single basic file with
|    the script name, or as a directory with the script name and basic file
|    with the name !Module. Resources should only be stored in these
|    directories. A means will eventually be provided for generating help
|    from within these. Files which require others to be loaded previously
|    should include a !Depend file in their directory containing the names
|    of those modules which it depends on. These should be modules whose
|    functions it uses, or overloads.
|
+-Obsolete :
|    Scripts which are no longer required, or are no longer being supported
|    will reside in here. Their use is not recommended. The retention is for
|    posterity and... well... you never know :-)
|
+-User :
     The user specific directory.
     This contains two types of file, those which are user editable, and
     those which are generated by the scripts to describe the users
     preferences. Currently there is no distinction between these; this
     may change in a future release.
     Basically, this directory should be able to be left static from one
     update to the next. 


The Scripts themselves are described below :
