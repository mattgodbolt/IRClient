Done: (0.43)

è Misc script fixes, to make Input work, and other stuff that was working
  before but I seem to have broken...

è Dave's Boooogs file things fixed ::
 > - Illegal window handle trying to close a channel:
 >   - channel window stayed open,
 >   - the panes disappeared,
 >   - I think it's to do with whether the input focus is left inside the
 >     window, possibly related to...
 > - Is PROCKillDisplay working okay?
 >   My Headlines module uses it, as does config, but none of them seem to be
 >   releasing old windows - i.e. when you kill and recreate a window, the old
 >   contents are still there.
 >
 > - HotList's make default entry doesn't work.
 >
 > - IBar menu 'Preferences...' should be 'Choices...'
 >
 > - Hotlist window -> Change yes/no sprite to optoff/opton
 >                  -> Increase x-size of window so there's a gap on the right
 >                     hand side.
 >
other stuff pending being done (not as nasty)

è Hotlist saves out so it doesn't reverse its order every load...


Done: (0.42)

è SYS "foo" TO a.b done

è Looked at FOR a.b=1 TO 2 - decided not worth it in long run - if you beg to
  differ it should be not too bad

è Sorted out at least beginnings of foo.bar$ where bar$ is dynamically sorted
  out - problems with a.b.b.b.c where .b. is a dynamic overload - see the ~test
  file

è MAlloc 1.07 used

è PROCStartupStatus(foo$) added which allows a bit of multi-tasking during
  loading, and a bit of info to the user as to why IRClient takes so long
  to load :)

è Misc re-entrancy bugs fixed

è IRCClasses needs re-writing - gonna do that soon

Done: (0.41)

è Bug in menu parameter passing fixed! (I'm a berk)

è More bugs fixed, like re-entrancy problem in Construct and FN re-entrancy in

-- previous donefile --
Done: (0.40)

è Rather late...single line IFs - only needed 6 lines changing....dunno why
  I didn't do it at the start...

è Removal of loadsa defunct calls to StripSpaces in IRBasic which are not needed
  now 'cos of all whitespace being stripped on load

è New hton function (htonl()) as stolen from ARM - very cunning :))) Have a
  loook (it's in IRCSource)

è SynchCodeAreas parameters fixed (didn't actually realise it took any!)

è Bug in the whitespace stripper fixed (no more memory freed tho' :( )

è Dave Thomas' Templates and sprites added, and a minor fix to the redraw code
  imped to make them look better.

è PROC re-entrancy problems fixed - your new code should now work!

è Memory wrapper routines and strcmp/strlen routines streamlined, and made
  cache-aware == more speed!!!!!!!! (noticeably, even!)

è Clipboard stuff added so key bindings can use clipboard

è Bug in File class fixed - which shows up the following problem:
NB BUG IN += AND -= - don't use @ or FN on either side till I work out why!

è Magrathea changed to use single-line IFs - although I think it's a bit older
  than the one you've got - check first!

Enjoy!
