Complete re-write of IRClient using 100% new code, and using EqNet as the
Internet back-end.  An entire scripting language is added.

v0.17 (*)   : BASIC programming language re-invented, in assembler, much to
              the amusement of my immediate peers.  Limited though it is, much
              of the rest of the client will be developed within this language.
              I'm mad, but there you go. (1/4/96)
v0.18 (*)   : As far as can be told, the scripting language is in, stable, and
              works.  Development of the client proper begins. (14/4/96)
v0.19       : Things are starting to look promising; IRClient undergoes its first
              live test which is a complete success.  Released to a few registered
              beta-testers.
v0.20       : After feedback from users (thanks fortywo and zarni) the user interface
              has been changed considerably - for the better.  Few patches here and there;
              stability much greater than in v0.19.  The end nears...
v0.21	    : Some minor patches and bugfixes
v0.22       : Guess what - more bugfixes!

......
v0.32	    : First decent release in a long time - many bugs fixed
v0.36	    : Many internal changes which manifest themselves as bug fixes :)
v0.37	    : The features introduced in 0.36 are now apparent - the reference-
	      counted garbage collector is now operational!
v0.38-0.40* : Many bugs in GC fixed, new module deals with memory allocation
              which is much faster.  Script files now pre-processed for speed
              and memory size reasons
