                                ================

Version 1.00 (16 Mar 1998)
     
Introduction
------------
This is a minor patch for Wimp_SendMessage. Basically, there is a 'bug' in
the Wimp which has only come to light recently causing the sender and my_ref
fields of any Wimp_SendMessage block to not be updated if they live in a
dynamic area.

This patch means they will be updated.


Usage
-----
   Run the !Create file. That's it.
   Hopefully, the code will be assembled with no errors and all that in
future will be required is the running of the !Run code file.

    
How it works
------------
The code simply copies the message block to an area of memory we /can/ update,
sends the message, then returns the correct parameters to the caller.
Re-entrancy is not dealt with, so if you want to send multiple messages on a
SendMessage (by WimpSWIve, etc) you're going to come unstuck.

Source code
-----------
   This program requires the !JFPatch pre-assembler to make the code. This is
a simple text-to-basic assembler which takes a text assembler file, makes a
basic program from it to assemble, assembles it and returns any errors. It is
available from Justin Fletcher's website (users.essex.ac.uk/users/gerph) or
directly by mailing to Gerph@essex.ac.uk.
   All source code and the resultant module must be distributed together.


WimpSWIVe
---------
   This program require WimpSWIve (v0.05) to be installed before it will run
correctly. It provides easy access to filtering Wimp calls other than
Wimp_Poll (provided by FilterManager) and is provided with NewerLook (which
is ok, but takes a bit of getting used to).
   The WimpSWIVe module is © Andrew Clover, and if copied should be copied
with the documentation which is provided. Refer to the file WSWI-Help for
more details.
