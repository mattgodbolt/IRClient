RCS logging (04 Feb 1998)
===========
Here, at my computer, I have RCS logs of almost all the programs in IRClient.
The idea is that I can finally keep track of what's happening.

If you want to change the files then I suggest you retain all the attributes
of the RCS I've left. If you want to use RCS yourself then try to check the
files in using a different name from 'gerph' as this can confuse me if you
return them to me.
