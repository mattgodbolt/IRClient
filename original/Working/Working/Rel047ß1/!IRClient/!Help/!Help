!IRClient - IRC client for RISC OS
=========   ======================

For license details please see the file !IRClient.!Help.License

IRClient is an easy(ish) to use IRC client for RISC OS.  It should be
reasonably straightforward to understand if you have IRC experience, but if not
you'd better check the documents in the directory which should have opened when
this document did.

*******************************  PLEASE NOTE  ******************************* 

è This program requires a resolver module, for example ANT's Resolver.
  Alternatively DNSResolver may be obtained from the Freenet site at
  http://freenet.barnet.ac.uk/freenet/s.brodie/

è This program *WILL NOT WORK WITH THE DOGGYSOFT TERMITE INTERNET SUITE*
  Please don't blame me for this - complain to Doggysoft for using a non-
  standard API for their TCP/IP stack.

è This program isn't Freeware.   It's Shareware, and myself and Justin would
  really like it if you could spare a tenner for a full version.  We're both
  poor you see.

Thanks for reading this file!!  Now please go read the Docs in the directory
