Known bugs
-===- -==-

There are problems with use of SLIRP with IRClient.  I'm not sure quite how to
approach these, as SLIRP isn't really a 'proper' Internet connection.  If
inspiration strikes anyone, give me a bell!

Selecting blank lines and dragging the mouse up has strange effects

Very occasionally the panes of a channel get left on the screen after you've
left it.

The garbage collector is too slow.

There are possible script incompatibilities.

Much of the internal class system is under development.
