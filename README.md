# IRClient

1990s-era ARM assembly implementation of IRC. Preserved for posterity

Developed on an Archimedes while I was at Uni. Initially by me, but eventually Justin Fletcher joined in
and contributed a huge amount of awesome stuff.

`original` directory here has a dump of all I have left (thanks to Justin). Most of the source is lost, but I have some around still. There's a python script for turning the basic files into readable things

`Source.bas` is the most recent text version of the source.
